# Dark Sky
To aid the Hoosier National Forest in their mission to be designated an International Dark Sky Park, this system will gather, record, and present light pollution data from various sites in Hoosier National Forest.
The website can be used by the public to view and download light sensor data. There is also an admin side that allows for sensor management.
