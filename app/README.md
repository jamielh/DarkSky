## Public Site
#### Main Page
* You can view the twitter feed of the Hoosier National Forest to see any information or notices that they may have.
* You have access to the map, which shows sensors and their light readings.  
	* The markers on the map have a number on them which represents the maximum amount of light that they sensed during the previous night.
	* The circle around each marker represents the average of the light data that the sensor saw in the past 7 days.  Similar to the markers, it has 4 color options: Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red, where green represents the least amount of light seen and red is the most.  
	* When clicking a marker, you can see the hourly readings of that sensor the previous night, and also have the option to get directions to the sensor and look at its data in graph format.
* Finally, to the right of the page there is some general information about the map, and a **Download Sensor Data** link, where all of the sensor data is publicly available in CSV format to use for data analysis.

#### Graphs and Charts
