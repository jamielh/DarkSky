## Admin Site
In the admin site, you can view all of the sensors in the database, add a sensor, and remove a sensor.
You may change your password by selecting the 'My Account' option from the menu, and then clicking 'Change your password.' Passwords have no requirements, but we recommend creating a strong,  unique password.
